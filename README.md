<h3>App & Widgets</h3>
This is an expo project ejected to be managed in Xcode. Each iOS widget is an individual extension (which is necesarry to have individual widget titles and descriptions). The iOS widget files can be found <a href="./ios-widgets">here</a>.

The main app is written with JavaScript in App.js. Run in an React Native Expo environment (or any environment that would support App.js) to test. I can't upload the entire project since there is confindental information in the files, such as apple developer IDs and more.

The Android version is written entirely in Kotlin with Android Studio. I couldn't get the React Native part to work with the native Android version, so I opted for this tedious approach (rewriting the app).

<h3>Api</h3>
View the quotes, and corresponding php script to fetch them, <a href="./server-side">here</a>.

<h3>More</h3>
I raised the price to 1$, as the increased amount of users came with some more costs.

Nuff said, peep these preview images:
